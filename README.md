🔍 What is DSA and Algorithms?
📊 Data Structures (Strukture podataka)
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) represent an advanced way of organizing data. While most algorithms and data structures are already implemented in standard libraries, it is crucial to understand how these common structures work "under the hood." This knowledge allows you to write more efficient code and make better decisions when solving complex problems. 🚀
🧠 Algorithms (Algoritmi)
An algorithm is a set of clearly defined steps executed in a specific order to solve a problem or complete a task. Simply put, it is a sequence of logical steps that need to be followed for the program to work. The key is understanding how many steps are necessary and how to organize them to create a program that performs the desired operation efficiently. 🧑‍💻
📈 Big O Notation (Big O)
Big O notation helps analyze and compare the performance of algorithms. It describes:

Time Complexity (Vremenska složenost): How much time an algorithm takes to execute based on the input size. ⏱️
Space Complexity (Prostorna složenost): How much memory the algorithm uses during execution, also depending on input size. 💾
Big O helps us evaluate how an algorithm scales as the input size increases, without measuring exact runtime or memory usage.

🚀 Example: Understanding Time vs Space Complexity
Time Complexity: If Code 1 completes a task in 15 seconds but uses a lot of memory, it is evaluated based on time complexity. We're focused on how fast it can execute.

Space Complexity: If Code 2 takes 45 seconds to complete the same task but uses less memory, we evaluate it based on space complexity. We're interested in how much memory it uses, even if it takes more time to finish.

🧩 Algorithm Complexity Analysis: Omega, Theta, and Omicron
Let's say we have an array of 7 elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

Omega (Best case): The best case occurs when searching for the first element (1). The search ends immediately with just one operation.
Theta (Average case): The average case occurs when searching for the middle element (4), requiring a few steps.
Omicron (Worst case): The worst case occurs when searching for the last element (7), requiring a complete search through the entire array.
⏳ O(n) – Linear Time Complexity Explained
Imagine a function printNumbers(n) that contains a loop:

java
Copy code
void printNumbers(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
This function executes the loop n times. If n = 20, it will process 20 elements.



In the graph, the horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the number of elements, while the vertical axis (y-axis) represents the number of operations. As n increases, the number of operations grows proportionally.

⚡ Key Takeaway: Drop the Constants
When analyzing Big O notation, we typically drop constant factors. For example:

If a function has a time complexity of O(2n), we simplify it to O(n) because constants are not significant in large-scale data.
