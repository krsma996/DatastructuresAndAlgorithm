# Java Data Structures and Algorithms 🧑‍💻📊

This repository tracks my journey through various data structures and algorithms, with detailed explanations in both English and Serbian. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the concepts, their uses, and practical applications.

## 📚 What is DSA and Algorithms? 🤔

### 1. **Data Structures (Strukture podataka)**
- DSA represent a high-level way of organizing data to make algorithms more efficient. 

### 2. **Algorithms (Algoritmi)**
- An algorithm is a set of steps followed to solve a problem or complete a task.

### 3. **Big O Notation (Big O Notacija) 📈**
- Big O notation describes the time and space complexity of algorithms. It helps analyze the performance of algorithms as the input size grows.

## 🔍 **Algorithm Complexity Analysis** 🧠

### 🔹 **Omega (Best Case)**
- The best case occurs when searching for the first element in an array. 

### 🔹 **Theta (Average Case)**
- The average case occurs when searching for the middle element.

### 🔹 **Omicron / Big O (Worst Case)**
- The worst case occurs when searching for the last element, processing all elements one by one.

## 🕒 **O(n) – Linear Time Complexity Explained** ⏱️

Imagine a function with a `for` loop:

```java
void printNumbers(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
The complexity of this function is O(n), because the number of operations grows proportionally to n. As the input size increases, the execution time increases as well
```

🏎️ Rule: Drop the Constants ⚡
When analyzing Big O, we focus on the most significant terms and ignore constants to simplify the complexity.
